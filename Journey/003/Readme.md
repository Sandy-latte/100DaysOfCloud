# Passed AWS CCP 


-I passed my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam today!

## Cloud Research


-The exam is about the same level as the mock exams I did and the concepts are clearly within the scope. Mostly it just wanted to test your knowledge about the concept and services AWS offer thus there were barely scenario questions in the exam. Notice that sometimes it would frame the sentences/wordings of answers differently rather than the content you see directly on their website/in the whitepaper

-The concept/services of Snowfamily, ECS, and EKS rarely appeared but the 'Shared Responsibility Model' linked to different AWS services, RDS, and EC2 concept showed up a lot

-Might want to differentitate the differences between IAM and IAM Identity Centre (successor to AWS Single Sign-On, https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/), the concept was tested twice 

-(The quality of local test centres depends. Mine was like an OKAY experience)
