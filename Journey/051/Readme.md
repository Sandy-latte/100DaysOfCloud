## Kick off Linux! 

Started the [Linux beginner course] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-50-most-used-linux-terminal-commands/). Runned the command 'wsl --install' in Powershell on my Windows 10 PC but it failed. Ubuntu can't be worked with properly. Found some [possible solutions] (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1152199/wslregisterdistribution-failed-with-error-0x800701). To sort out the solutions during the weekend.
