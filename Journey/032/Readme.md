## Capstone project 

## Scenario

✍️ The company you work at is planning to use s3 as the storage layer for their data lakes solution. initially, the data that will be ingested into the data lake will come from 3 locations: 1) IoT sensors that send real-time data 2) a database with historical records 3) supplental data from third-party entities for enriching internally generated data.
the company has tasked u with designing solutions for ingesting this data into their data lake, and each loca(IoT sensors, database, and third party) will need its own ingestion solution. from their, u will need to also design a solution for how to clean/transform the data so that it can be analysed 
the company uses Apache Hadoop-based software. they prefer to use similar tech in the cloud so that they dont need to retrain their analytics team on many new tech 
to create dashboards that show viz representations of the insights 

## Task

✍️ create an architecture diagram that depicts the data-lakes-and-analytics solution u would design with a few paragraphs that explain both why you designed the solution and how the solution works
