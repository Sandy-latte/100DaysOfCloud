AWS Data Service (for designing a serverless data analytics solution on aws)

## Cloud Research

-https://aws.amazon.com/cn/big-data/datalakes-and-analytics/?nc=sn&loc=0

-see the 4 sections below (Data lakes and data storage, Data analytics, Data movement, Predictive analytics and machine learning)

Data lakes and data storage-Amazon S3, Amazon S3 Glacier, AWS Lake Formation 

#Amazon S3
-archive data at the lowest cost, run cloud-native applications, build a data lake, back up and restore critical data 

#Amazon S3 Glacier (https://aws.amazon.com/cn/s3/storage-classes/glacier/)

#AWS Lake Formation (https://aws.amazon.com/cn/lake-formation/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc)
-a service that you can use to set up a secure data lake in days 

Data Analytics-Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, Amazon OpenSearch Service 

#Amazon Athena 
-an interactive query service that you can use to analyse data in Amazon S3 by using SQL. it's serverless-->pay for only the queries that you run 

-to use athena-->point to your data in s3, define the schema, and start querying by sql. anyone with sql skills can use it 

#Amazon EMR (https://aws.amazon.com/cn/emr/?c=a&sec=srv)
-big data solution for peta-byte-scale data processing, ML that use open-source frameworks (e.g. Apache Spark)

-could take a month to master it 

-run big data and what-if analysus by using algorithms and predictive models 

-extract data from various sources, process it, and make it available 

-analyse events from streaming real-time data sources-->then creates long-running and fault-tolerant streaming data pipelines

-connect to Amazon SageMaker Studio for large-scale modeling and analysis 

#Amazon OpenSearch Service 
-perform interactive log analytics, real-time app monitoring 

-open source 

Data movement 

#Amazon Kinesis (https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/)

-collect and analyse real-time data with amazon kinesis 

#AWS DMS 

#AWS Glue (https://aws.amazon.com/glue/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc)
-serverless data integration service 

Predictive Analytics and ML

#Amazon SageMaker
-for any general ML solution

#Amazon Rekognition (not a data analtics service but part of a data analytics solution)
-designed to analyse images, streaming, and stored vids <3 seconds 

#Amazon Comprehend 
-NLP service that uses ML to gain insights in texts. for med case-->Amazon Comprehend Medical-->focuses on extracting info from unstructured med text
